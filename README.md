# cxx-modules-sandbox

This repository is intended to host various corner cases with C++20's modules
and how to build them with various build systems.

Is your build system not represented here? Please submit a PR to add its build
configuration and it'd be great if it could be added to the CI configuration.
The `Dockerfile` for the CI run is stored on the `docker` branch of this
repository.
